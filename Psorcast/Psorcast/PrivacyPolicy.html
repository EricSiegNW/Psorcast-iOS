<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or
“us”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit biomedical research organization in the United
States, created to enhance how researchers approach the complexity of human
biological information and the treatment of disease. We have developed a mobile
application (the “Psorcast App”) to gain insights into the variability of
psoriatic disease symptom burden as measured by active task measurements and
self-reported health information using a mobile app based research platform. The
goal of the Psorcast research study (the “Study”) is to map the landscape of
psoriatic disease symptoms and quality of life over time in real-world
settings. </span></p>
